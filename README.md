Part 3: How does disposable personal income influence the popularity of different movie genres? 

The regression analysis sheds light on the connection between disposable personal income (DPI) and the popularity of various movie genres. The correlation coefficients unveil the strength and direction of this connection, with higher values indicating a more robust association between DPI and genre popularity.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

Correlation Coefficients:

Action: 0.93
Adventure: 0.97
Comedy: 0.97
Thriller: 0.88
Drama: 0.88

These correlation coefficients signify strong positive correlations between DPI and the popularity of Action, Adventure, and Comedy genres, with values nearing 1. Conversely, Thriller and Drama genres also display positive correlations, though slightly weaker. This suggests that consumers with higher disposable incomes are inclined to spend on entertainment, including movie tickets or subscriptions to streaming services offering these genres.

linear regression equations:
Action: y=0.001x+5385838.94
Adventure: y=0.001x+4565180.12
Comedy: y=0.001x+3465162.44
Thriller: y=0.001x+5234958.15
Drama: y=0.001x+066070.52

Despite the positive correlation, the slope of the regression lines for all genres is extremely close to zero (0.001). This implies that while there's a subtle positive trend, the relationship isn't markedly linear. In essence, changes in DPI have only a minimal direct impact on the revenue generated from each genre. In other words, while a positive relationship exists between DPI and genre popularity, the lack of a significant linear relationship suggests that other regression models or additional factors may better capture this relationship or influence consumer preferences and revenue generation within each genre.

This nuanced understanding underscores the complexity of consumer behavior and the multifaceted nature of the factors influencing entertainment consumption patterns. It emphasizes the importance of comprehensive analysis and consideration of various factors in predicting and adapting to shifts in consumer demand within the film industry. Understanding this relationship can inform strategic decision-making within the film industry, helping stakeholders better anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand based on economic factors. By aligning their offerings with consumer preferences, filmmakers and industry players can enhance their competitiveness and profitability in the market.
